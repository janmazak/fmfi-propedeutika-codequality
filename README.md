# ConcatenateMatrices

##Run

This program takes a text file named "vstup.txt" as an input.  
The file needs to have two integers on the first line specifying  
the number of rows and columns that the subsequent matrices  
will have. Then each row of a new matrix needs to be on a  
separate line and have the same number of elements as the 
number of columns specified in the first line, divided by 
blank spaces. The number of lines for each matrix needs to be same  
as number of rows specified in the first line. User must give at  
least one matrix. The program will create a new matrix in which  
it will concatenate elements from all matrices that were given  
on input by parts. Then it will return this matrix to an output file  
named "vystup.txt" as a list.
